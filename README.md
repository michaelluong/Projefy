# Projefy
> Developed by Michael Luong

## Project Description
```
Projefy is a Project Managing Application catered towards helping teams to priortize their tasks.

In some teams, managing tasks can become a nightmare when task priorities are constantly changing. 
With the use of Projefy, I hope to create an application that can help those specific individuals 
maximize their efficiency by having the capability to re-organize their priorities in a simplistic, 
easy-to-use, drag-and-drop, user interface.

Projefy will be developed on the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, Node.js, and React.js), as well as 
Redux for accessing the whole STATE TREE of the Application.

## Development Tracker
I will be tracking my thoughts/progress as I build upon this application.
